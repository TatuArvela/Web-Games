## Pong
I must give credit to [this video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) for the base of this little game. I did make a bunch of adjustments however, especially to speeds, paddles and the AI.

## Snake
This one was also based on a [video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxplj6vs). Here I made a lot of changes to the scalability, appearance and structure of the game.
