## Pong
I must give credit to [this video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) for the base of this little game. I rewrote most of the code, which also made the gameplay very boring by accident. I might fix this (again) some day.

## Snake
This one was also based on a [video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs). Here I made a lot of changes to the scalability, appearance and structure of the game.
