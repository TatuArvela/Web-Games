## Credits

The design for the launcher is based
on [Ruckage's SNES mini EmulationStation theme](https://github.com/ruckage/es-theme-snes-mini).

## Pong

A take on the all-time classic Pong. I must give credit
to [this video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoWqdEACyLI) for the base of this little game. I have
rewritten most of the code, but the physics are still slightly flawed.

## Snake

A take on the classic Nokia Snake game. This one was also based on
a [video by Gamkedo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGmXxpIj6vs). Here I made a lot of changes to the scalability,
appearance and structure of the game.

## Tic-Tac-Toe

This one is based on [my earlier Unity version of Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/TatuArvela/Unity-Tic-Tac-Toe), and has
a Commodore-inspired, brutalist look.

## Super Mathgame

A mental calculation game with a synthwave look.

## Sudoku

A sudoku solver app with a classic Mac style.
